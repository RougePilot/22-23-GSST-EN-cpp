# Student Database Search
This program takes a "database" of stidents, ID numbers, and grades, then allows you to search for an ID number or last name and show the sutdents with matching information.

## How to Use:
- The program will ask if the user wants to search by ID number or by Last Name. Answer with 'ID' or "LName'.
- Then enter the desired ID Number or Last Name.
- The program will then output a table with the information.

### Notes:
- The "database" is in the format of: #### Name LName GPA
- The information is separated by spaces.
- The variable $n$ is to make it easier to adapt the later for loop to the number of students in the database. For now, the arrays will not let me use a variable to initialize their size.
- The file "StudentInfo.txt" is an example file for the program. Change the name of the file in the program if you wish to use a different file.
- More details on the variables are available as comments in the .cpp file.
