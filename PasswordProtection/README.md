# Password Protection
A program that password protects something, a calculator in this case.

## How to Use:
- The program will ask to enter the username and password.
- Then enter a username and password, separated by spaces.
- The program will then allow or deny access to the calculator program.

### Notes:
- The "database" is in the format of: Username Password
- The information is separated by spaces.
- The variable $n$ changes the size of the arrays to adapt to different numbers of students in the database.
- The file "UserPass.txt" is an example file for the program. Change the name of the file in the program if you wish to use a different file.
- More details on the variables are available as comments in the .cpp file.
- ### The "calculator.h" header file is needed to run the program.
